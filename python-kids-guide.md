### üìù Basic Python Concepts

#### 1. Print Statements - Making Python Talk
```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("My name is Alex")
print(2 + 3)  # This prints 5
```

#### 2. Variables - Storing Information
```python
name = "Alice"           # Text (string)
age = 10                 # Number (integer)
height = 4.5             # Decimal (float)
is_student = True        # True/False (boolean)
```

#### 3. Getting Input from Users
```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
print(f"Hi {name}! You are {age} years old.")
```

#### 4. Making Decisions with If Statements
```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age >= 13:
    print("You're a teenager!")
elif age >= 6:
    print("You're a kid!")
else:
    print("You're little!")
```

#### 5. Repeating Actions with Loops
```python
# For loop - repeat exact number of times
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")

# While loop - repeat until condition is false
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Hello!")
    count = count + 1
```

#### 6. Lists - Storing Multiple Things
```python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(colors[0])        # Prints "red" (first item)
colors.append("purple") # Adds purple to the list
print(len(colors))      # Prints how many items in list
```

#### 7. Functions - Reusable Code Blocks
```python
def greet_friend(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! Nice to see you!"

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Using the functions
message = greet_friend("Bob")
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(message)  # Hello, Bob! Nice to see you!
print(result)   # 8
```

### üê¢ Turtle Graphics - Drawing with Code

```python
import turtle

# Set up the screen
screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.bgcolor("lightblue")

# Create a turtle
artist = turtle.Turtle()
artist.shape("turtle")
artist.color("green")

# Draw a square
for i in range(4):
    artist.forward(100)
    artist.right(90)

# Draw a circle
artist.circle(50)

# Keep window open
screen.exitonclick()
```

### üéØ Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

#### 1. Indentation Errors
**Wrong:**
```python
if age > 10:
print("You're old enough!")  # Not indented!
```

**Right:**
```python
if age > 10:
    print("You're old enough!")  # Properly indented
```

#### 2. Forgetting Quotes for Text
**Wrong:**
```python
name = Alice  # Missing quotes!
```

**Right:**
```python
name = "Alice"  # Text needs quotes
```

#### 3. Using = instead of == for comparison
**Wrong:**
```python
if age = 10:  # Single = is for assignment
```

**Right:**
```python
if age == 10:  # Double == is for comparison
```
